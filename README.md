## Known bugs (Maybe for all SPRD device)

- USB features (adb, mtp, etc.) is unable to use.
- Userdata which is using `F2FS` for its filesystem will not be mounted. `EXT4` filesystem works normally.

Some devices have two or more releases. Pls make sure you have downloaded the latest release. 

If the device cannot be found, that means I haven't built it yet or I failed to build it. Please build it by yourself.
